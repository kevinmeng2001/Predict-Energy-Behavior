# Predict-Energy-Behavior

This project presents a comprehensive study on predicting energy behavior in prosumers with the aim of reducing energy imbalance costs. Detailed analysis and performance comparisons were conducted on various machine learning models including Linear Regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
